# CapitalMarket
Project in Xebia regarding Capital Market Forecast

Things we have achieved:
Prediction in R 
1.	Exponential Moving Average Algorithm (EMA)
2.	Simple Moving Average Algorithm (SMA)
3.	Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM)
4.	r-Part Algorithm
5.	Boosted Trees Algorithm
6.	K-nearest neighbour Algorithm (kNN)

We trained our dataset using these 6 algorithms and tested these algorithms on test data set and eventually found out kNN to be best suitable for our data set as it gave the highest precision and accuracy.

Factors Involved
We used Open Price, Close Price & Volume of the data set and predicted the polarity of the next day by analysing the trends of last 5 years data.

Sentiment Analysis
We performed the sentiment analysis of a particular company to calculate market sentiment of the company and performed
•	Calculated Mean sentiment score
•	Plotted graphs for frequency of positive and negative words and 
•	Created a Wordcloud.
